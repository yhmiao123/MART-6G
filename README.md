# MART-6G
This is the public repository of the Multi-Task Adaptive Ray-Tracing Platform for 6G (MART-6G) developed by Professor Jianhua Zhang's team at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. MART-6G is a ray-tracing simulator designed for 6G, aiming to provide accurate and efficient wireless channels for the construction of 6G digital twin worlds. MART-6G consists of three modules: 
-Environment Twin Module: Responsible for reconstructing building geometry.
-RT Engine Module: Integrates key algorithms including propagation, acceleration, calibration, and 6G-specific new features.
-Channel Generation Module: Generates channel multipaths, parameters, and statistical distributions.
