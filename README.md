# MART-6G
This is the public repository of the Multi-Task Adaptive Ray-Tracing Platform for 6G (MART-6G) developed by Professor Jianhua Zhang's team at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. MART-6G is a ray-tracing simulator designed for 6G, aiming to provide accurate and efficient wireless channels for the construction of 6G digital twin worlds. MART-6G consists of three modules: 
- **Environment Twin Module**: Responsible for reconstructing building geometry.  
- **RT Engine Module**: Integrates key algorithms including propagation, acceleration, calibration, and 6G-specific new features.  
- **Channel Generation Module**: Generates channel multipaths, parameters, and statistical distributions.

这是北京邮电大学张建华教授团队的 **面向多任务的射线追踪仿真平台** (MART-6G)的公开仓库。MART-6G是一款面向6G的射线追踪仿真器，旨在为为了6G数字孪生世界的搭建提供精确高效的无线信道。MART-6G包含三个模块:
- **环境孪生模块**负责重建建筑几何.
- **RT引擎模块**整合了传播、加速、校准、6G 特定的新功能等主要算法。
- **信道生成模块**负责生成信道多径、参数、统计分布。
